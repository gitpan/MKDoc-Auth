MKDoc::Auth - Authentication Framework for MKDoc::Core
======================================================

MKDoc::Auth is an authentication framework re-written from the MKDoc content
management system.

It provides the following facilities:

* Authentication
* Signup page
* Account confirmation
* Login / logout / log as someone else
* Edit account
* I have lost my login!
* I have lost my password!
* Delete account

This framework is a step further in our great 'open-source MKDoc as a bunch of
independant modules' plan.
